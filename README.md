Kitchen Counter is a food inventory tracking app developed with React from create-react-app.  
The app can accept inventory items and quantities and can also accept recipes with ingredient lists and instructions.  Using a recipe will automatically deduct the ingredient from the inventory, and the inventory can also be manually adjusted to account for using individual items.
Individual items and/or recipes can also be added to a Meal Plan.  This mealplan can then be used to generate a shopping list by comparing it to the current inventory.  The inventory is then automatically updated to reflect the shopping list being used.
